## Disclaimer
- We can not guarantee 100% treatment. We must "catch" the virus, and only after the research the virus enters the database. It takes time.
- *We are not responsible for any damage to your computer.* Everything that removes the utility is considered to be viral and adware. If you need it, download again. We are not responsible for any lost files or data.
- Utility is in Pre-Alpha-period, so there may be false positives and program errors. You must be patient.
- It is my hobby, not work.
